`Markdown` is a nicer format than `HTML`.

## Heading 2

Basic formatting such as **bold** and _emphasis_ and ~strikethrough~.

### Heading 3

A bullet point list:

- One
- Two
- Three

This paragraph as a [link](/en-US/docs/Web).

```Javascript
function foo() {
  return undefined + 1;
}
```

This next code block is generic

```
(+ (1 2))
```

And the last one is CSS:

```css other stuff
div#foo {
  color: pink;
}
```
