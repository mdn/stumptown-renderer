# HTML and CSS visual testing width Water.css

If you want to make a visual test on the correct use of HTML tags, you can use Water.css's Bookmarklet.
This bookmarklet transforms the page into a basic style without any effect on the classes.
This allows you to visually see if there may be issues with the correct use of the HTML TAGs.
