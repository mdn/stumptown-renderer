# Experiment: Reference links in JS code blocks

## Issue

<https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/4089>

## Overview

We add reference links for keywords to JS code blocks. When someone clicks
one of those links, we record a GA event.

## Start date

TODO: make more specific than "End of July"

## End date

2 weeks later

## Success metric

1. Multiple thousands of clicks on the reference links per-day
2. A couple of mentions on Twitter about the feature

## Analysis

Look at Google Analytics Events under `Code Block Reference Link`.
