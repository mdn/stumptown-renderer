title: Promise.any()
slug: Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any
summary: >-
  Promise.any() takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the
  promises in the iterable fulfils, returns a single promise that resolves with
  the value from that promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfil (if all of
  the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with
  an object that is still up for debate: either an array of rejection reasons or
  an AggregateError, a new subclass of Error that groups together individual
  errors. Essentially, this method is the opposite of Promise.all().

<p><code>Promise.any()</code> takes an iterable of {{JSxRef("Promise")}} objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfils, returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfil (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an object that is still up for debate: either an array of rejection reasons or an {{JSxRef("AggregateError")}}, a new subclass of {{JSxRef("Error")}} that groups together individual errors. Essentially, this method is the opposite of {{JSxRef("Promise.all()")}}.</p>

<div class="blockIndicator warning">
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> The <code>Promise.any()</code> method is experimental and not fully supported by all browsers. It is currently in the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any" rel="external">TC39 Candidate stage (Stage 3)</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre>Promise.any(<var>iterable</var>);</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
 <dt><code>iterable</code></dt>
 <dd>An <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/iterable">iterable</a> object, such as an {{JSxRef("Array")}}.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<ul>
 <li>An <strong>already resolved</strong> {{JSxRef("Promise")}} if the <var>iterable</var> passed is empty.</li>
 <li>An <strong>asynchronously resolved</strong> {{JSxRef("Promise")}} if the <var>iterable</var> passed contains no promises.</li>
 <li>A <strong>pending</strong> {{JSxRef("Promise")}} in all other cases. This returned promise is then resolved/rejected <strong>asynchronously</strong> (as soon as the stack is empty) when any of the promises in the given <var>iterable</var> resolve, or if all the promises have rejected.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

<p>This method is useful for returning the first promise that fulfils. It short-circuits after a promise fulfils, so it does not wait for the other promises to complete once it finds one. Unlike {{JSxRef("Promise.all()")}}, which returns an <em>array</em> of fulfillment values, we only get one fulfillment value (assuming at least one promise fulfills). This can be beneficial if we need only one promise to fulfil but we do not care which one does. Also, unlike {{JSxRef("Promise.race()")}}, which returns the first <em>settled</em> value (either fulfillment or rejection), this method returns the first <em>fulfilled</em> value. This method will ignore all rejected promises up until the first promise that fulfils.</p>

<h3 id="Fulfilment">Fulfilment</h3>

<p>If any of the passed-in promises fulfil, the returned promise asynchronously fulfils with the value of the promise that fulfilled, whether or not the other promises have fulfilled or rejected.</p>

<ul>
 <li>If an empty <var>iterable</var> is passed, then this method returns (synchronously) an already resolved promise.</li>
 <li>If any of the passed-in promises fulfill or are not promises, the promise returned by <code>Promise.any</code> is fulfilled asynchronously.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Rejection">Rejection</h3>

<p>If all of the passed-in promises reject, <code>Promise.any</code> asynchronously rejects with one of two options (which have not yet been agreed upon): either</p>

<ul>
 <li>an array containing <strong>all </strong>the rejection reasons of the <var>iterable</var> passed as the argument, or</li>
 <li>an {{JSxRef("AggregateError")}} object, which extends {{JSxRef("Error")}}, and contains a pointer to an array of exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="First_to_fulfil">First to fulfil</h3>

<p><code>Promise.any()</code> resolves with the first promise to fulfil, even if a promise rejects first. This is in contrast to {{jsxref("Promise.race()")}}, which resolves or rejects with the first promise to settle.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const pErr = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  reject("Always fails");
});

const pSlow = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, "Done eventually");
});

const pFast = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Done quick");
});

Promise.any([pErr, pSlow, pFast]).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(value);
  // pFast fulfils first
})
// expected output: "Done quick"
</pre>

<h3 id="Rejections_with_AggregateError">Rejections with <code>AggregateError</code></h3>

<p><code>Promise.any()</code> rejects with an {{jsxref("AggregateError")}} if no promise fulfils.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const pErr = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  reject('Always fails');
});

Promise.any([pErr]).catch((err) =&gt; {
  console.log(err);
})
// expected output: "AggregateError: No Promise in Promise.any was resolved"
</pre>

<h3 id="Displaying_the_first_image_loaded">Displaying the first image loaded</h3>

<p>In this example, we have a function that fetches an image and returns a blob. We use <code>Promise.any()</code> to fetch a couple of images and display the first one available (i.e. whose promise has resolved).</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function fetchAndDecode(url) {
  return fetch(url).then(response =&gt; {
    if(!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    } else {
      return response.blob();
    }
  })
}

let coffee = fetchAndDecode('coffee.jpg');
let tea = fetchAndDecode('tea.jpg');

Promise.any([coffee, tea]).then(value =&gt; {
  let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(value);
  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = objectURL;
  document.body.appendChild(image);
})
.catch(e =&gt; {
  console.log(e.message);
});</pre>
