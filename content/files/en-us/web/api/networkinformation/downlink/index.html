summary: >-
  The downlink read-only property of the NetworkInformation interface returns
  the effective bandwidth estimate in megabits per second, rounded to the
  nearest multiple of 25 kilobits per seconds. This value is based on recently
  observed application layer throughput across recently active connections,
  excluding connections made to a private address space. In the absence of
  recent bandwidth measurement data, the attribute value is determined by the
  properties of the underlying connection technology.
