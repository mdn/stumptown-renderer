<p>Indicates how bright the screen's backlight is, on a scale from 0 (very dim) to 1 (full brightness); this value is a double-precision float.</p>

<p>You can read and write this attribute even when the screen is disabled, but the backlight is off while the screen is disabled. If you write a value of X into this attribute, the attribute may not have the same value X when you later read it. Most screens don't support as many different brightness levels as there are doubles between 0 and 1. The value's precision might be reduced before storing it.</p>
