<p>The <code><strong>Window.getAttention()</strong></code> method attempts to get the user's attention. The mechanism for this happening depends on the specific operating system and window manager.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="syntaxbox">window.getAttention();
</pre>

<h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>

<p>On Windows, the taskbar button for the window flashes, if this hasn't been disabled by the user.</p>

<p>On Linux, the behaviour varies from window manager to window manager - some flash the taskbar button, others focus the window immediately. This may be configurable as well.</p>

<p>On Macintosh, the icon in the upper right corner of the desktop flashes.</p>

<p>The function is disabled for web content. Neither Gecko nor Internet Explorer supports this feature now for web content. <code>getAttention</code> will still work when used from <a href="en/Chrome">chrome</a> in a Gecko application.</p>
