<p><span class="seoSummary">A <strong>secure context</strong> is a <code>Window</code> or <code>Worker</code> for which there is reasonable confidence that the content has been delivered securely (via HTTPS/TLS), and for which the potential for communication with contexts that are <strong>not</strong> secure is limited. </span>Many Web APIs and features are accessible only in a secure context. The primary goal of secure contexts is to prevent {{interwiki("wikipedia", "man-in-the-middle attack", "man-in-the-middle attackers")}} from accessing powerful APIs that could further compromise the victim of an attack.</p>

<h2 id="Why_should_some_features_be_restricted">Why should some features be restricted? </h2>

<p>Some APIs on the web are very powerful, giving an attacker the ability to do the following and more:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Invade a user's privacy.</li>
 <li>Get low-level access to a user's computer.</li>
 <li>Get access to data such as user credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="When_is_a_context_considered_secure">When is a context considered secure?</h2>

<p>A context will be considered secure when it's delivered securely (or locally), and when it cannot be used to provide access to secure APIs to a context that is not secure. In practice, this means that for a page to have a secure context, it and all the pages along its parent and opener chain must have been delivered securely.</p>

<p>For example, a page delivered securely over TLS is <strong>not</strong> considered a secure context if it has a parent or ancestor document that was not delivered securely; otherwise, the page would then be able to expose sensitive APIs to the non-securely delivered ancestor via <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">postMessage</a> messages. Similarly, if a TLS-delivered document is opened in a new window by an insecure context without <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#noopener">noopener</a> being specified, then the opened window is <strong>not</strong> considered to be a secure context (since the opener and the opened window could communicate via postMessage).</p>

<p>Locally delivered files such as <em>http://localhost</em> and <em>file://</em> paths are considered to have been delivered securely.</p>

<p>Contexts that are not local must be served over <em>https://</em> or <em>wss://</em> and where the protocols used should not be considered deprecated. </p>

<h2 id="Feature_detection">Feature detection</h2>

<p>Pages can use feature detection to check whether they are in a secure context or not by using the {{domxref("WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext", "isSecureContext")}} boolean, which is exposed on the global scope.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if (window.isSecureContext) {
  // Page is a secure context so service workers are now available
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/offline-worker.js").then(function () {
    ...
  });
}</pre>
