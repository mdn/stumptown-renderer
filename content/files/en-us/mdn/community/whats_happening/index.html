<p>MDN is brought to you by the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN">MDN community</a>. Here are some ways that we share information about what we're doing.</p>

<h2 id="Blogs">Blogs</h2>

<h2 id="Status_boards_and_dashboards">Status boards and dashboards</h2>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">Documentation status</a> pages to see what's going on across the full breadth of MDN content. You'll be able to see what articles need to be written or updated, what topics need the most help, and much, much more.</p>

<h2 id="MDN_meetings">MDN meetings</h2>

<p>There are a number of regular meetings for tracking and sharing progress on various MDN-related projects and processes. These are described on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN meetings wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>To get a general sense of what's happening, the best meeting to attend is the MDN Community meeting, which occurs every two weeks on Wednesdays, 10:00 US Pacific time (UTC-0800 October-March, UTC-0700 in March-October), in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/devmo">#mdn</a> <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC" title="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">IRC</a> channel. See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings/Community" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Community_meetings">MDN community meetings</a> wiki page for agendas and notes from past meetings.</p>
