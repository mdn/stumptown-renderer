<p class="summary">The "work" of MDN happens on the MDN site, but the "community" also happens through (asynchronous) discussion and (synchronous) online chat and meetings.</p>

<h2 id="Asynchronous_discussions">Asynchronous discussions</h2>

<p>To share information and have ongoing discussions, <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">MDN has its own category ("MDN") in the Mozilla Discourse forum</a>. Use this category for all topics related to MDN, including documentation content creation, translation, and maintenance; MDN platform development; and planning, goal-setting, and progress tracking.</p>

<ul>
 <li>To join Mozilla's Discourse, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/signing-up-and-logging-in/16017">Signing up and logging in</a>; if you have a Mozilla LDAP account, you can use that instead of "Login with email".</li>
 <li>To subscribe to the MDN category, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/subscribing-to-categories-and-topics/16024">Subscribing to categories and topics</a>.</li>
 <li>(Optional) If you prefer to interact with Discourse primarily by email, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mailman-mode/15279">Set up a mailing list experience for yourself</a>. You can start a discussion in Discourse by sending an email message to: <a href="mailto://mdn@mozilla-community.org">mdn@mozilla-community.org</a>. If you use Discourse via email, you can reply to a message by replying to the notification email that you receive. If you want to intersperse comments inline within a reply, please put two carriage-returns before and after your inline chunks, so that Discourse parses them correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Historical_archives">Historical archives</h3>

<p>Prior to June 2017, MDN-related discussions took place in mailings lists that were gatewayed and archived with Google groups. If you want to search these past discussions, you can look at the Google groups corresponding to the old mailing lists. (Yes, we know these names are overlapping and confusing. Historical accident. Sorry about that.)</p>

<h2 id="Synchronous_chat">Synchronous chat</h2>

<p>Mozilla's platform for real-time discussions is <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, a chat protocol for which <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/">Mozilla has its own server</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org">MDN Web docs chat room</a> is a major channel for discussing the content of MDN. We talk about writing, organization of content, and so on. We also have "water cooler" conversations hereâ€”it's a way our community can keep in touch and just hang out. This room is most likely to be active during weekdays in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>You might want to learn more about using <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix">Matrix with Mozilla</a>, and, if you're really into it, install a stand-alone Matrix application such as <a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot.im</a>.</p>

<h3 id="What_about_IRC">What about IRC?</h3>

<p>For many years, Mozilla used Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for real-time discussions. As of early 2020, IRC has been deprecated in favor of Matrix. You may see references to IRC channels in many places, including on MDN. You can help by updating links to IRC channels that you find on MDN to point to the corresponding Matrix rooms instead. If you're not sure what the Matrix room is for a topic, ask in the <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#general:mozilla.org">General</a> room. Projects or topics that are no longer active might not have a Matrix room; in such cases, just delete the link.</p>

<h2 id="Join_our_meetings_and_other_events">Join our meetings (and other events)</h2>

<p>The MDN team holds a number of regular meetings that are open to the MDN community. See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN Meetings</a> page on the Mozilla wiki for details on the schedule, agendas and notes, and info on how to join.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d35383434313235392d323530%40resource.calendar.google.com">MDN Events calendar</a> for these and other meetings, local meetups, and other events. The recurring meetings are summarized on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN Meetings wiki page</a>.</p>
