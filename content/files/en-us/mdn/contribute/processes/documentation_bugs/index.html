<dl>
 <dt>dev-doc-needed keyword</dt>
 <dd>When a Mozilla product bug results in new features, or modifies existing ones, that affect documentation on MDN, the development team adds "dev-doc-needed" in the <strong>Keywords</strong> field of the product bug in Bugzilla. This sends a notification to the MDN team. (MDN team members often abbreviate "dev-doc-needed" to "DDN".)</dd>
 <dt>Documentation requests</dt>
 <dd>When someone notices that a document on MDN is incorrect or incomplete, they can file an <a href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/new?template=issue-template.md&amp;projects=mdn/sprints/2&amp;labels=user-report">issue in GitHub</a> to request that it be fixed. Prior to January 2019, MDN doc requests were logged in Bugzilla, where there is still a large backlog.</dd>

<h2 id="How_to_help">How to help</h2>

<p>If you're interested in working on DDN bugs or doc request issues, start by looking for an issue that you might want to help with.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://mzl.la/2FlCPwl">Product bugs with the dev-doc-needed keyword</a> need some kind of change to MDN content because of the product change that was made. If you decide to tackle one of these, jump over to <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Resolve_a_dev-doc-needed_bug">How to resolve a dev-doc-need bug</a>.</li>
 <li>Doc requests that are prioritized as P5 are unlikely to be fixed by staff members, but fixes from community members are welcome. You can find lists of <a href="https://mzl.la/2C9PjEj">P5 bugs on Bugzilla</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/labels/P5">P5 issues on GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've selected a doc request, use the following general strategy:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Contact the person who the issue is assigned to; that person can help you figure out what you need to do to make the appropriate changes on MDN, and what would be considered "done" for that issue. If no one is assigned to the issue, you can post on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">MDN discussion forum</a> to ask for advice on how to proceed.</li>
 <li>If the current owner agrees, assign the bug to yourself. (If you realize you're unable to finish work on a bug, add an explanatory comment, and un-assign yourself.)</li>
 <li>When you are finished, ask for a review of your work. (The original owner is a good person to ask.) If the reviewer approves what you've done, close the bug.</li>
</ol>
