<p>Some tools or operations on MDN require elevated access privileges not available to ordinary users.</p>

<p>If you want or need privileges for a tool, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Write an email message to <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org">mdn-admins@mozilla.org</a>, with a description of what you need and why. <strong>Include your MDN account name.</strong></li>
 <li>Make sure to explain why you meet the conditions gaining privileges, for each tool for which you're requesting privileges. See the "<a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Tools/Page_moving#Conditions_for_gaining_this_privilege">Conditions for gaining this privilege</a>" section for the tool(s) in question.</li>
 <li>Once your request is approved, one of the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Roles/Admins">MDN admins</a> can grant you access to the tool(s) you need.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case of misuse, abuse, or a significant problem (like a newly discovered dangerous bug in the tool), any admin can suspend access to a tool at any time.</p>
