<div class="moreinfo"><strong>Why does MDN need my email address?</strong><br>
<br>
Your email address is used for account recovery. MDN administrators may need use your email address to contact you about your account or your activity on the site.<br>
<br>
In addition, you can sign up for notifications (such as <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Watch_a_page">when specific pages change</a>) and messages. For example, if you join our beta testing team, you might receive email about new features that need testing.<br>
<br>
Your email address is never displayed on MDN. It is always used according to MDN's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/">privacy policy</a>.<br>

<div class="note">If you log in to MDN via GitHub, and you use a "noreply" email address on GitHub, you will <em>not</em> receive messages (including notifications when you subscribe to pages) from MDN.</div>
