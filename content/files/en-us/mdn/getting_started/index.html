Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.</span></p>

<p>Every part of MDN (docs, demos, and the site itself) are created by an open community of developers. Please, join us!</p>

<h2 id="3_simple_steps_to_MDN">3 simple steps to MDN</h2>

<p>MDN is a wiki, where <strong>anyone</strong> can add and edit contents. You don't need to be a programmer or know a lot about technologies. There are plenty of things that need to be done, from the simple (proofreading and correcting typos) to the complex (writing API documentation).</p>

<p>Contributing is easy and safe. Even if you make a mistake, it's easily fixed. Even if you don't know exactly how things should look, or your grammar isn't all that good, don't worry about it! We have a team of people whose job it is to make sure that MDN's contents are as good as possible. Someone will be along to make sure your work is tidy and well-written. Share what you know and follow your strengths.</p>

<h3 id="Step_1_Create_an_account_on_MDN">Step 1: Create an account on MDN</h3>

<p>To begin your contributions to MDN, you need to have an account on MDN. For details, please see <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">how to create an account</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Step_2_Pick_a_task_to_complete">Step 2: Pick a task to complete</h3>

<p>Now that you are logged in, read the descriptions of different task types in {{anch("Possible task types", "the list below")}}, and decide which one most appeals to you. You can pick any task you like and begin your contribution.</p>

<h3 id="Step_3_Do_the_task">Step 3: Do the task</h3>

<p>Once you've decided what kind of task you want to do, find a specific page, code example, etc. to work on, and just do it!</p>

<p>Don't worry about doing it perfectly; other MDN contributors are here to help fix errors that slip through. If you want to experiment before doing something "for real", you can edit the <a href="/en-US/docs/Sandbox">Sandbox</a> page. If you have questions as you go, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Community">Community</a> page for info on mailing lists and chat channels where you can get answers.</p>

<p>When you're done, feel free to pick another item, or see below for <a href="#Other_things_you_can_do_on_MDN">other things you can do on MDN</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Possible_task_types">Possible task types</h2>

<p>There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skill set and interests. Even though some tasks may be daunting, we do have lots of simple activities available. A lot of them need only five minutes (or less!) of your time. Along with the task and its short description, you will find the approximate time that each type of task typically takes.</p>

<p>You can report problems by <a class="external" href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/new?template=issue-template.md">filing a documentation issue</a>. (5 minutes)</p>

<p>Please give the issue a descriptive title. (It's not helpful to say "Dead link" without saying where you found the link. Pro tip: Most "dead links" on MDN are to articles that haven't been written yet.) Under "Request type", put an "x" in the brackets for "Correction or update" if you found a problem, or for "New documentation" if there's something missing from MDN. Under "Details", provide as much information as you know or have time to describe about the problem and where to find correct information. This can include people ("talk to so-and-so") as well as Web links.</p>
