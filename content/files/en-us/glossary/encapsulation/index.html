summary: "Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one\_component (for example, a class) and then controlling access to that\_component to make a \"blackbox\" out of the object.\_Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed\_outside\_the class), not the hidden implementation."

<p>Encapsulation is the packing of data and {{glossary("function","functions")}} into one component (for example, a {{glossary("class")}}) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the {{glossary("object")}}. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.</p>
