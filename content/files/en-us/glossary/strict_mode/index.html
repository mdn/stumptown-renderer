<p>JavaScript's <strong>strict mode</strong> is a way to <em>opt in</em> to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "{{Glossary("Sloppy_mode", "sloppy mode")}}". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it <em>intentionally</em> has different semantics from normal code.</p>

<p>Strict mode for an entire script is invoked by including the statement <code>"use strict";</code> before any other statements.</p>
