<p>Your new Firefox executable can be found in: <em>$OBJDIR/dist/bin/firefox</em>. You can run it from there.</p>

<p>If you need to move it, e.g. to another machine, you can run:</p>

<pre>./mach package</pre>

<p>This should create an OS-specific package, e.g. a tarball on Linux, which will appear in <em>$OBJDIR/dist</em>. You can also copy the <em>$OBJDIR/dist/bin</em> directory -- be sure to use a copy method that expands soft links -- but the result will be much larger than what you get with <code>mach package</code>.<em> </em> On Windows you may want to read about <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/installer/windows/installer/InstallerBuild.html">Windows Installer Builds.</a></p>
