This article provides a list of best practices for your patch content that reviewers will check for or require. Following these best practices will lead to a smoother, more rapid process of review and acceptance.</span></p>
</div>

<h2 id="Good_web_citizenship">Good web citizenship</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Make sure new web-exposed APIs actually make sense and are either standards track or preffed off by default.</li>
 <li>In C++, wrapper-cache as needed. If your object can be gotten from somewhere without creating it in the process, it needs to be wrapper-cached.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Correctness">Correctness</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The bug being fixed is a valid bug and should be fixed.</li>
 <li>The patch fixes the issue.</li>
 <li>The patch is not unnecessarily complicated.</li>
 <li>The patch does not add duplicates of existing code ('almost duplicates' could mean a refactor is needed). Commonly this results in "part 0" of a bug, which is "tidy things up to make the fix easier to write and review".</li>
 <li>If QA needs to verify the fix, you should provide steps to reproduce (STR).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Quality">Quality</h2>

<ul>
 <li>If you can unit-test it, you should unit-test it.</li>
 <li>If it's JS, try to design and build so that xpcshell can exercise most functionality. It's quicker.</li>
 <li>Make sure the patch doesn't create any unused code (e.g., remove strings when removing a feature)</li>
 <li>All caught exceptions should be logged at the appropriate level, bearing in mind personally identifiable information, but also considering the expense of computing and recording log output. [Fennec: Checking for log levels is expensive unless you're using Logger.]</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Style">Style</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Follow the <a href="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Coding_Style" title="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Coding_Style">style guide</a> for the language and module in question.</li>
 <li>Follow local style for the surrounding code, even if that local style isn't formally documented.</li>
 <li>New files have license declarations and modelines.</li>
 <li>New JS files should use strict mode.</li>
 <li>Trailing whitespace (git diff and splinter view both highlight this, as does hg with the color extension enabled). Whitespace can be fixed easily in Mercurial using the <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CheckFilesExtension">CheckFiles extension</a>. In git, you can use git rebase --whitespace=fix.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Security_issues">Security issues</h2>

<ul>
 <li>There should be no writing to arbitrary files outside the profile folder.</li>
 <li>Be careful when reading user input, network input, or files on disk. Assume that inputs will be too big, too short, empty, malformed, or malicious.</li>
 <li>Tag for sec review if unsure.</li>
 <li>If you're writing code that uses JSAPI, chances are you got it wrong. Try hard to avoid doing that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Privacy_issues">Privacy issues</h2>

<ul>
 <li>There should be no logging of URLs or content from which URLs may be inferred.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: Android Services has Logger.pii() for this purpose (e.g., logging profile dir)].</li>
 <li>Tag for privacy review if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Resource_leaks">Resource leaks</h2>

<ul>
 <li>In Java, memory leaks are largely due to singletons holding on to caches and collections, or observers sticking around, or runnables sitting in a queue.</li>
 <li>In C++, cycle-collect as needed. If JavaScript can see your object, it probably needs to be cycle-collected.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: If your custom view does animations, it's better to clean up runnables in onDetachFromWindow().]</li>
 <li>Ensure all file handles and other closeable resources are closed appropriately.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: When writing tests that use PaintedSurface, ensure the PaintedSurface is closed when you're done with it.]</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Performance_impact">Performance impact</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Check for main-thread IO [Fennec: Android may warn about this with strictmode].</li>
 <li>Remove debug logging that is not needed in production.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Threading_issues">Threading issues</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Enormous: correct use of locking and volatility; livelock and deadlock; ownership.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: All view methods should be touched only on UI thread.]</li>
 <li>[Fennec: Activity lifecycle awareness (works with "never keep activities"). Also test with oom-fennec (<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/blassey_mozilla.com/oom-fennec/%29">https://hg.mozilla.org/users/blassey_mozilla.com/oom-fennec/)</a>].</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Version files, databases, messages</li>
 <li>Tag messages with ids to disambiguate callers.</li>
 <li>IDL UUIDs are updated when the interface is updated.</li>
 <li>Android permissions should be 'grouped' into a common release to avoid breaking auto-updates.</li>
 <li>Android APIs added since Froyo should be guarded by a version check.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Preffability">Preffability</h2>

<ul>
 <li>If the feature being worked on is covered by prefs, make sure they are hooked up.</li>
 <li>If working on a new feature, consider adding prefs to control the behavior.</li>
 <li>Consider adding prefs to disable the feature entirely in case bugs are found later in the release cycle.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: "Prefs" can be Gecko prefs, SharedPreferences values, or build-time flags. Which one you choose depends on how the feature is implemented: a pure Java service can't easily check Gecko prefs, for example.]</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Strings">Strings</h2>

<ul>
 <li>There should be no string changes in patches that will be uplifted (including string removals).</li>
 <li>Rev entity names for string changes.</li>
 <li>When making UI changes, be aware of the fact that strings will be different lengths in different locales.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Documentation">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The commit message should describe what the patch is changing (not be a copy of the bug summary). The first line should be a short description (since only the first line is shown in the log), and additional description, if needed, should be present, properly wrapped, in later lines.</li>
 <li>Adequately document any potentially confusing pieces of code.</li>
 <li>Flag a bug with dev-doc-needed if any addon or web APIs are affected.</li>
 <li>Use Javadocs extensively, especially on any new non-private methods.</li>
 <li>When moving files, ensure blame/annotate is preserved.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<ul>
 <li>For HTML pages, images should have the alt attribute set when appropriate. Similarly, a button that is not a native HTML button should have role="button" and the aria-label attribute set.</li>
 <li>[Fennec: Make sure contentDescription is set for parts of the UI that should be accessible]</li>
</ul>
