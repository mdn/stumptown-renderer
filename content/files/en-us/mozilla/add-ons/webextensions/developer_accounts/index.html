<p>Developer accounts for addons.mozilla.org are integrated with <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/signup">Firefox Accounts</a>, which lets you access and manage multiple Mozilla services from one account. You can manage your Firefox Account from <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/settings">accounts.firefox.com/settings</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Setting_a_display_name">Setting a display name</h3>

<p>It’s important to set a display name on your <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/users/edit">profile on addons.mozilla.org </a>to increase transparency with users, add-on reviewers, and the greater community.</p>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p>Your Firefox Account display name will not sync to your profile on addons.mozilla.org. You will need to set your developer account display name from your profile on addons.mozilla.org.  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="Blocked_accounts">Blocked accounts</h3>

<p>To mitigate malicious actors from submitting spam to addons.mozilla.org, we will not accept submissions from accounts that use a disposable temporary email address, or that have submitted multiple add-ons that violate our <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Reviews">Add-on Policies</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe your account has been incorrectly blocked, please email amo-admins [at] mozilla [dot] com and include a link to your developer profile.</p>
