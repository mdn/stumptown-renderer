<p>The most convenient way to package your extension is to use <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/web-ext_command_reference#web-ext_build">web-ext build</a>. This tool automatically excludes files that are commonly unwanted in packages, such as <code>.git</code> files. Otherwise, follow the instructions below for your operating system.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>. The ZIP file must be a ZIP of the extension's files themselves, not of the directory containing them.</p>
