title: Porting a Google Chrome extension
slug: Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Porting_a_Google_Chrome_extension
summary: >-
  The browser extension APIs are designed to promote cross-browser compatibility
  among extensions. The WebExtension APIs is, therefore, to a large extent,
  code-compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera.
  Extensions written for these browsers will, in most cases, run in Firefox with
  just a few changes. Almost all of the WebExtension APIs provide support for
  callback functions under the chrome namespace, the same as Chrome. The only
  APIs that aren't supported in the chrome namespace are those that are
  intentionally incompatible with Chrome. In those cases, the API documentation
  page states that support is provided only in the browser namespace. The
  process of porting an extension from Chrome or Opera is, therefore, relatively
  straightforward:

<ol>
 <li>Review your use of <code>manifest.json</code> features and Chrome extension APIs against the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Chrome_incompatibilities">Chrome incompatibilities reference</a>. Mozilla provides a service that can help to automate this step: <a href="https://www.extensiontest.com/">extensiontest.com</a>. If you're using features or APIs that aren't supported in Firefox, you might not be able to port your extension.</li>
 <li>Install your extension in Firefox by using <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging">about:debugging</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Testing_out_an_extension">the web-ext tool</a> (similar to Chromeâ€™s command-line tools).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging">Test your extension</a>.</li>
 <li>If you have any problems, contact us on the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-addons">dev-addons mailing list</a> or <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/webextensions">#webextensions</a> on <a class="external external-icon" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">IRC</a>.</li>
 <li>Package your web extension, <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Publishing_your_WebExtension">manually</a> or using the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Packaging_your_extension"> web-ext</a> tool.</li>
 <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution/Submitting_an_add-on">Create an account on addons.mozilla.org then submit your add-on for signing and distribution</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use the Chrome command-line option for loading an unpacked extension, check out the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext">web-ext</a> tool which automates temporary installation in Firefox for development.</p>
