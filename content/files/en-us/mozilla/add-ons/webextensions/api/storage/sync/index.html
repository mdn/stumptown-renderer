<p>Represents the <code>sync</code> storage area. Items in <code>sync</code> storage are synced by the browser, and are available across all instances of that browser that the user is logged into (e.g. via Firefox sync, or a Google account), across different devices.</p>

<p>For Firefox a user must have <code>Add-ons</code> checked under the "Sync Settings" options in <code>"about:preferences"</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the implementation of <code>storage.sync</code> in Firefox relies on the Add-on ID. If you use <code>storage.sync</code>, you must set an ID for your extension using the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings">browser_specific_settings</a></code> manifest.json key.</p>

<p>The main use case of this API is to store preferences about your extension and allow the user to sync them to different profiles. You can store up to 100KB of data using this API. If you try to store more than this, the call will fail with an error message. The API is provided without any guarantees about uptime or performance.</p>
