<p>In this module <span class="seoSummary">we answer a few fundamental questions about server-side programming — "What is it?", "How does it differ from client-side programming?", and "Why is it so useful?".</span> We then provide an overview of some of the most popular server-side web frameworks, along with guidance on how to select the most suitable framework for creating your first site. Finally, we provide a high-level introductory article about web server security.</p>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before starting this module, you don't need to have any knowledge of server-side website programming, or indeed any other type of programming. </p>

<p>However, you do need to understand how the web works. We recommend that you first read the following topics:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server">What is a web server?</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_software_do_I_need">What software do I need to build a website?</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server">How do you upload files to a web server?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With that basic understanding, you'll be ready to work your way through the modules in this section. </p>

 <dd>Welcome to the MDN beginner's server-side programming course! In this first article, we look at server-side programming from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?", "How does it differ from client-side programming?", and "Why it is so useful?". After reading this article, you'll understand the additional power available to websites through server-side coding.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview">Client-Server overview</a></dt>
 <dd>Now that you know the purpose and potential benefits of server-side programming, we're going to examine in detail what happens when a server receives a "dynamic request" from a browser. As most websites' server-side code handles requests and responses in a similar way, this will help you understand what you need to do when writing your own code.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks">Server-side web frameworks</a></dt>
 <dd>The last article showed you what a server-side web application needs to do in order to respond to requests from a web browser. Now we show how web frameworks can simplify these tasks, and help you choose the right framework for your first server-side web application.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security">Website security</a></dt>
 <dd>Website security requires vigilance in all aspects of website design and usage. This introductory article won't make you a website security guru, but it will help you understand the first important steps you can take to protect your web application against the most common threats.</dd>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This topic deals with server-side frameworks, and how to use them to create websites. If you are looking for information on client-side JavaScript frameworks, consult our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks</a> module.</p>

<h2 id="Assessments">Assessments</h2>

<p>This "first steps" module doesn't have any assessment because we haven't yet shown you any code. We do hope that at this point you have a good understanding of what sorts of functionality you can deliver using server-side programming, and that you have made a decision about what server-side web framework you will use to create your first website.</p>
