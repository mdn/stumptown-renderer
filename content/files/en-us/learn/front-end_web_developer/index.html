<p>Welcome to our front-end web developer learning pathway!</p>

<p>Here we provide you with a structured course that will teach you all you need to know to become a front-end web developer. Simply work through each section, learning new skills (or improving existing ones) as you go along. During each section, you will find exercises and assessments to test your understanding before you move forward.</p>

<h2 id="Subjects_covered">Subjects covered</h2>

<p>The broad subjects covered are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Basic setup and learning how to learn</li>
 <li>Web standards and best practices (such as accessibility and cross-browser compatibility)</li>
 <li>HTML, the language that gives web content structure and meaning</li>
 <li>CSS, the language used to style web pages</li>
 <li>JavaScript, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web</li>
 <li>Tooling that is used to facilitate modern client-side web development.</li>
</ul>

<p>The different sections are designed to be worked through in order, but each one is also self-contained. If you, for example, already know HTML well, you can quite happily skip ahead to the CSS section.</p>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You don't need any previous knowledge to start this course. All you need is a computer that can run modern web browsers, an internet connection, and a willingness to learn.</p>

<p>If you are not sure whether front-end web development is for you, and/or you want to get a gentle introduction before starting on a more complete course, you should work through our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Getting started with the web</a> module first, before going further.</p>

<h2 id="Getting_help">Getting help</h2>

<p>We have tried to make learning front-end web development as comfortable as possible, however, you will probably still get to the point where you get stuck because you don't understand something, or some code is just not working like you think it should be.</p>

<p>Don't panic. We all get stuck sometimes, whether we are beginner or professional web developers. Learning how to learn (TBD, LINK) article will provide you with a series of hints and tips for looking up information and helping yourself, and if you are still stuck, feel free to post a question on our <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/">Discourse forum</a>.</p>

<p>Let's get started. Good luck!</p>
