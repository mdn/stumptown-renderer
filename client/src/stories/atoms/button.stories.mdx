# Buttons

TBD

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Interactive">{<Button>Primary button</Button>}</Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable />

## Usage

Prmary buttons are used for primary calls to action.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Primary button" args={{ state: "primary" }}>
    {(args) => <Button {...args}>Primary button</Button>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

For secondary calls to action, use the `outline` button.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Secondary button" args={{ state: "outline" }}>
    {(args) => <Button {...args}>Secondary button</Button>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Forms and Modals

Forms and modals often have more than one action a user can take. Secondary actions should use an `outline` button while primary actions should use a solid variant.

When the result of an action is positive and non-destructive, use either one of the following buttons.

<Canvas>
  <div style={wrapper}>
    <Button state="outline positive">Back</Button>
    <Button state="positive">Subscribe</Button>
  </div>
</Canvas>

When the result of an action is negative or destructive, use one of the following buttons.

<Canvas>
  <div style={wrapper}>
    <Button state="outline danger">Cancel</Button>
    <Button state="danger">Close account</Button>
  </div>
</Canvas>

For some interactions there may be some fields we want a user to complete before they can submit a form or complete a task. Also, it is generally a good practice to disable a button once a user has clicked it to prevent duplicate submissions.

In these instances you should use the `inactive` state button.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Inactive button" args={{ state: "inactive" }}>
    {(args) => <Button {...args}>Processing...</Button>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Icon buttons

When using an icon within a button you have the option of showing the icon either on the left or right of the label text.

#### Icon on the right

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Icon right button"
    args={{
      state: "positive icon right",
    }}
  >
    {(args) => (
      <Button {...args}>
        Icon on right <Arrow />
      </Button>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Icon on the left

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Icon left button"
    args={{
      state: "positive icon left",
    }}
  >
    {(args) => (
      <Button {...args}>
        <Github /> Icon on right
      </Button>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
