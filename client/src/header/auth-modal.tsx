// Why using `next=${window.location.href}` instead of `next=${window.location.pathname}`?
// The reason is that you might be doing local development with Yari and
// that means that logging in takes you to a different domain entirely.
// In local development, you want to tell that other server that
// "Hey I came from this other development domain". And when it's all in
// production, the Yari and the Kuma, it's harmless to do this because the
// domain will actually be identical. django-allauth *discards* the `?next`
// parameter if it is an absolute URL with a different host name. That's
// right and sensible, but it's totally worth doing an exception for the
// greater development experience of mixing Kuma and Yari all in development
// mode.
